Method:
Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in neutral state in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution. The provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute molecule in each solvent, for all solutes. The number of solvent molecules was determined in order to create a box with at least 4.0 nm on each edge, so at least 2124 water molecules in each case, and 352 in the case of cyclohexane.  Solute, Water, and cyclohexane were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of Quantum Mechanical Polarizable Force Field (QMPFFF3) see e.g. (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242) and its subsequent modification/improvement called ARROW. Some systematic errors related to hydrophobic parts of molecules was corrected. 

In-house tools in the Arbalest code and various scripts in Octave/Matlab were used for setting up the initial configuration and subsequent post processing of generated data.
Solvation free energy was computed via TI (Thermodynamic Integration) using 10 lambda states, with annihilation of interactions treated analogously to that for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378). Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 450 ps production phase at each lambda value using a Berendsen barostat and Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 0.5 ps and 1 ps, respectively of which we typically discarded another 50 ps as equilibration. In cases where convergence was suspect, longer simulation times were employed.  
Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points, and  were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted distribution coefficients) reported. The statistical errors (SEM) of the run was determined not by multiple runs, but by analysis of correlation times (as in supplementary materials of PNAS (2008) 105:10378).
For species that may undergo ionization in aqueous phase we had applied correction log(D)=log(P)- log(1+10^(pH-pKa))
