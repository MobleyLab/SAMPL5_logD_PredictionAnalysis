# Analysis of 6 'Best' Group Predictions

The 6 best sets of predictions by average unsigned error.  
These were chosen so that there were no repeats in the group. 
The analysis was done on prediction sets: 16, 02, 73, 27, 60, 40

* bestGroupPlots.py: Python script that actually does the analysis. It calculates the average prediction for all 6 data sets for each molecule. 
* BestGroups_Compare.pdf: Comparison plot showing average prediction and experimental result.
* BestGroups_QQ.pdf: QQ plot using a propogated uncertainty for the average prediction
* BestGroups_data.txt: Table of average values for each SAMPL5 molecule
