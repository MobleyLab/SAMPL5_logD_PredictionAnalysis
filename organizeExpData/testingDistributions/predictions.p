S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p281
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'
p282
aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p283
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'
p284
aS'All the other molecules were simulated with the provided files.'
p285
aS'The absolute free energies obtained by use of the above protocol were corrected to account for specific errors:'
p286
aS'Protocol A) A correction term for missing no cutoff interactions in Coulombic potential in vacuum simulations'
p287
aS'Protocol B) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding.'
p288
aS'Protocol C) Same as B but a correction term for electrostatic energies was also applied. This term was adapted from Reif and Oostenbrink (J. Comput. Chem. 2014, 35, 227-243) to handle corrections for an atom-based Barker Watts reaction-field cutoff. Poisson electrostatic calculations were performed with the software APBS and a custom periodic-boundary Poisson solver that was kindly provided by Prof. Philippe H\xc3\xbcnenberger (ETH Zurich).'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p783
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'
p784
aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p785
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'
p786

p788
aS'Protocol A) A correction term for missing no cutoff interactions in Coulombic potential in vacuum simulations'
p789
aS'Protocol B) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding.'
p790
aS'Protocol C) Same as B but a correction term for electrostatic energies was also applied. This term was adapted from Reif and Oostenbrink (J. Comput. Chem. 2014, 35, 227-243) to handle corrections for an atom-based Barker Watts reaction-field cutoff. Poisson electrostatic calculations were performed with the software APBS and a custom periodic-boundary Poisson solver that was kindly provided by Prof. Philippe H\xc3\xbcnenberger (ETH Zurich).'
p791
aS'Protocol D) Protocol C were applied for charged compounds, while protocol B for neutral ones.'

S'These distribution coefficients were estimated using Thermodynamic Integration of classical explicit molecular simulations. These involved construction of a thermodynamic cycle connecting the cyclohexane and aqueous phases through transformation to the vapor state. What distinguishes these calculations from other similar solvation free energy calculations is the nature of the surrounding phases. Both the cyclohexane and water phases were the result of a model optimization to better capture the dielectric constant of the given liquid. This involved general polarization of the water model and the introduction of a permanent dipole moment on a united atom cyclohexane model to model induced moments within the liquid. The solute is treated with the standard GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges. In general, we expect the solutes to systematically favor distribution into the cyclohexane phase, as the AM1-BCC partial charges tend to be underpolarized for electric field calculations in condensed phases.'

aS'The provided .mol2 files, in their given tautomeric state only, were used to generate single model solutes that were solvated in rhombic dodecahedral boxes of the phase of interest. The simulation box size was variable and depended upon having at least 12 \xc3\x85 of solvent between the solute and a periodic boundary box edge. The water solvent used was the dielectrically corrected H2O-DC model. The cyclohexane solvent used was a specially optimized united-atom model of cyclohexane that properly captures the experimental density, dielectric constant and enthalpy of vaporization. As stated above, the solutes were represented using the GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges. These solute parameters were assigned using antechamber and parmchk2, and the molecule was converted to GROMACS form using acpype.py.'
p974
aS'Free energy calculation protocols were taken from previous work in our group on solvation free energy calculations, with minor updates for GROMACS 5.0.4. Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 26 lambda states, with six lambda values used for discharging the solute molecule and another 20 for decoupling Lennard-Jones interactions with the remainder of the system. Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in GROMACS with the steepest descents algorithm, equilibrated under NVT (berendsen thermostate) for 100 ps, equilibrated under NPT conditions for 200 ps (Langevin thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat), this before an extended 5 ns of NPT sampling for each lambda value simulation.'
p975
aS'Statistical analysis was done following procedures previously utilized by our group (errors from block averages and error accumulation over the integration process). The predicted distribution coefficients simply come from subtraction of the solvation free energies in the various states, with error propogated to the log(D) value. The systematic error reported comes from a mean absolute error estimate from previous calculations in our group using this set of solvent and solute models.'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in neutral state in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution. The provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute molecule in each solvent, for all solutes. The number of solvent molecules was determined in order to create a box with at least 4.0 nm on each edge, so at least 2124 water molecules in each case, and 352 in the case of cyclohexane.  Solute, Water, and cyclohexane were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of Quantum Mechanical Polarizable Force Field (QMPFFF3) see e.g. (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242) and its subsequent modification/improvement called ARROW. Some systematic errors related to hydrophobic parts of molecules was corrected.'

aS'Solvation free energy was computed via TI (Thermodynamic Integration) using 10 lambda states, with annihilation of interactions treated analogously to that for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378). Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 450 ps production phase at each lambda value using a Berendsen barostat and Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 0.5 ps and 1 ps, respectively of which we typically discarded another 50 ps as equilibration. In cases where convergence was suspect, longer simulation times were employed.'
p1245
aS'Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points, and  were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted distribution coefficients) reported. The statistical errors (SEM) of the run was determined not by multiple runs, but by analysis of correlation times (as in supplementary materials of PNAS (2008) 105:10378).'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated by combining statistical-mechanical calculations using a modified EC-RISM solvation model (JPCB 112, 4337, 2008) for neutral forms of the compounds in both water (mSPC/E, JCAMD 24, 343, 2010 and cyclohexane (united atom, JCC 22, 1205, 2001), combined with an empirical estimate of the most abundant neutral tautomers at pH 7.4 using MoKa, and Corina for generating 3D structures. Protonation  equilibria were ignored in this prediction set. If the relative abundance of tautomers were comparable, only the globally optimal tautomer from EC-RISM calculations (see below) was selected for further investigation.'

aS'The key equation evaluated is:'
p1374
aS'logD = logP'
p1375
aS'logP was computed from the difference of solvation free energies of species between cyclohexanol and water. Solvation free energies within the EC-RISM context are given by the difference of vacuum and solution electronic energy plus a 3D RISM-derived estimate of the excess chemical potential (my^ex). Here we first adjust the original PSE-2 closure expression (JCP 129, 236101, 2008) with a partial molar volume (PMV) correction using available data from the Minnesota Solvation Database for water and cyclohexane solvation free energies. For water and cyclohexane a three-parameter model (scaling my^ex and PMV) was chosen, yielding independent estimates of the model error of 1.2 kcal/mol (neutrals) for water and 0.8 kcal/mol for cyclohexane. Applying the optimized water parameters to the subset of cyclohexane data for which water solvation free energies are also available, yields an error of 1.5 kcal/mol for water. These errors (1.5 and 0.7 kcal/mol) give a propagation estimate of the total model error of at least 1.5 for logD (the true error is definitely larger due to the neglect of protonation equilibria). The statistical error estimate resulting from computing the RMSD between a 2-parameter and a 3-parameter cyclohexane model is around 0.9 for logD.'
p1376
aS'Technically, (1) the conformations of all species were first sampled by generating a set of 200 geometries using a distance geometry embedding scheme with the default settings of RDKit. (2) Geometry optimization was performed in effective dielectric environments representing both phases using the ALPB model in Amber with GAFF 1.5 and AM1-BCC charges. (3) Clustering using RDKit with the criteria to select structures with max. 5 kcal/mol of their force field energy above the global minimum and structural RMSD < 0.5 Angstroems was followed by (4) quantum-chemical optimization in the respective PCM solvent (Gaussian 09) by B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p). (5) Only the globally optimal structure was subjected to further EC-RISM/3D-RISM treatment. For cyclohexane, we assumed gas and solution phase geometries to be identical whereas a relaxation term was accounted for in the case of water. (6) EC-RISM calculations in water were done by MP2/6-311+G(d,p)/PSE-2 (Gaussian 03 as quantum chemistry package). (7) 3D-RISM/PSE-2 was sufficient for the uncharged united atom cyclohexane model. The corresponding solvent site susceptibility was constructed by extracting intermolecular and intramolecular correlation functions from explicit MD simulations of pure cyclohexane using Gromacs.'

S'Distribution coefficients were calculated for all solutes using the difference in solvation free energy (SFE) at infinite dilution in water and cyclohexane as calculated by the 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) [1,2]. Parameters for solute topologies and coordinates from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [3] were assigned with the antechamber, parmchk2 and tleap programs in AmberTools 15 [4], starting from the provided .mol2 files. No attempt was made to predict tautomer or protonation state.'

aS'Solvent Models'
p1701
aS'Bulk solvent properties for use in 3D-RISM calculations were produced with rism1d in AmberTools 15 using the partial series expansion of order 3 (PSE-3) [6] closure. Water was represented with the cSPC/E water model [7] while a united atom model was developed for cyclohexane. An initial parameterization for cyclohexane used typical united atom Lennard-Jones parameters but was found to give a negative isothermal compressibility, indicating an unphysical solution. An alternate model was developed by calculating XRISM [8,9] solutions for a range of larger sigma and epsilon values and using these solutions to calculate free energies for a training set of 84 solutes in cyclohexane [10] when using the Universal Correction (UC) [11] with the 3D-RISM procedure described below. SMILES strings for all training set solutes were obtained from PubChem and converted to .mol2 files using OpenBabel 2.3.2 [12]. Topologies and coordinates were then assigned as described for the SAMPL5 solutes. Values of sigma = 4.3 to 5.3 A and epsilon = 0.8, 0.988 and 1.4 kcal/mol were used for cyclohexane and the final parameters of sigma = 4.7 A and epsilon = 1.4 kcal/mol were selected. SFEs from these parameters and corrected with UC compared well against the training data, with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.650 kcal/mol, mean unsigned error = 0.539 kcal/mol, R^2 = 0.832 and a slope of 0.789. In addition, the isothermal compressibility was 0.71 1/GPa, close to the experimental value of 1.120 1/GPa [13], and the radial distribution function was in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and neutron and X-ray diffraction results [14].'
p1702
aS'3D-RISM'
p1703
aS'SFE were calculated using the rism3d.snglpnt program in AmberTools 15 [7]. A 0.3 A grid spacing was used for the solvent box with a minimum 30 A buffer distance between the solute and the box edge. A 30 A cut off was used for solvent-solute interactions, beyond which Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated and electrostatic interactions were interpolated from a sparse grid. The 3D-RISM equation was coupled with the PSE-3 closure and solved to a residual tolerance of 10e-10. The large solvent box size and low residual tolerance provide a numerical accuracy of at least 0.01 kcal/mol. SFEs were calculated by applying PC/DFT [16] to the closed form analytic expression for the PSE-3 closure [6].  To assess the model accuracy, the above procedure was applied to calculate partition coefficients for neutral amino acid side chain analogues [15]. The error estimates for our SAMPL5 predictions are taken from the RMSE in this test set.'

S'These distribution coefficients were estimated using Thermodynamic Integration of classical explicit molecular simulations. These involved construction of a thermodynamic cycle connecting the cyclohexane and aqueous phases through transformation to the vapor state. What distinguishes these calculations from other similar solvation free energy calculations is the nature of the surrounding phases as well as use of a simple force field optimizer for general solute molecules. Both the cyclohexane and water phases were the result of a model optimization to better capture the dielectric constant of the given liquid. This involved general polarization of the water model and the introduction of a permanent dipole moment on a united atom cyclohexane model to model induced moments within the liquid. The solute is treated with a dielectrically corrected GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges. This force field preserves neat liquid properties while scaling up AM1-BCC charge magnitudes to be more appropriate for condensed phase simulations.'
p1851
aS'The provided .mol2 files, in their given tautomeric state only, were used to generate single model solutes that were solvated in rhombic dodecahedral boxes of the phase of interest. The simulation box size was variable and depended upon having at least 12 \xc3\x85 of solvent between the solute and a periodic boundary box edge. The water solvent used was the dielectrically corrected H2O-DC model. The cyclohexane solvent used was a specially optimized united-atom model of cyclohexane that properly captures the experimental density, dielectric constant and enthalpy of vaporization. As stated above, the solutes were initially represented using the GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges, and a simple experimentally supported procedure was used to modulate the charge and Lennard-Jones sigma parameters. These solute parameters were assigned using antechamber, parmchk2, and home-built modulation code, and the molecule was converted to GROMACS form using acpype.py.'
p1852
aS'Free energy calculation protocols were taken from previous work in our group on solvation free energy calculations, with minor updates for GROMACS 5.0.4. Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 26 lambda states, with six lambda values used for discharging the solute molecule and another 20 for decoupling Lennard-Jones interactions with the remainder of the system. Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in GROMACS with the steepest descents algorithm, equilibrated under NVT (berendsen thermostate) for 100 ps, equilibrated under NPT conditions for 200 ps (Langevin thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat), this before an extended 5 ns of NPT sampling for each lambda value simulation.'
p1853
aS'Statistical analysis was done following procedures previously utilized by our group (errors from block averages and error accumulation over the integration process). The predicted distribution coefficients simply come from subtraction of the solvation free energies in the various states, with error propogated to the log(D) value. The systematic error reported comes from a mean absolute error estimate from previous calculations in our group using this set of solvent and solute models.'

S'Distribution coefficients were calculated for all solutes using the difference in solvation free energy (SFE) at infinite dilution in water and cyclohexane as calculated by the 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) [1,2]. Parameters for solute topologies and coordinates from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [3] were assigned with the antechamber, parmchk2 and tleap programs in AmberTools 15 [4], starting from the provided .mol2 files. No attempt was made to predict tautomer or protonation state.'

aS'Solvent Models'
p1980
aS'Bulk solvent properties for use in 3D-RISM calculations were produced with rism1d in AmberTools 15 using the partial series expansion of order 3 (PSE-3) [6] closure. Water was represented with the cSPC/E water model [7] while a united atom model was developed for cyclohexane. An initial parameterization for cyclohexane used typical united atom Lennard-Jones parameters but was found to give a negative isothermal compressibility, indicating an unphysical solution. An alternate model was developed by calculating XRISM [8,9] solutions for a range of larger sigma and epsilon values and using these solutions to calculate free energies for a training set of 84 solutes in cyclohexane [10] when using the Universal Correction (UC) [11] with the 3D-RISM procedure described below. SMILES strings for all training set solutes were obtained from PubChem and converted to .mol2 files using OpenBabel 2.3.2 [12]. Topologies and coordinates were then assigned as described for the SAMPL5 solutes. Values of sigma = 4.3 to 5.3 A and epsilon = 0.8, 0.988 and 1.4 kcal/mol were used for cyclohexane and the final parameters of sigma = 4.7 A and epsilon = 1.4 kcal/mol were selected. SFEs from these parameters and corrected with UC compared well against the training data, with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.650 kcal/mol, mean unsigned error = 0.539 kcal/mol, R^2 = 0.832 and a slope of 0.789. In addition, the isothermal compressibility was 0.71 1/GPa, close to the experimental value of 1.120 1/GPa [13], and the radial distribution function was in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and neutron and X-ray diffraction results [14].'
p1981
aS'3D-RISM'
p1982
aS'SFE were calculated using the rism3d.snglpnt program in AmberTools 15 [7]. A 0.3 A grid spacing was used for the solvent box with a minimum 30 A buffer distance between the solute and the box edge. A 30 A cut off was used for solvent-solute interactions, beyond which Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated and electrostatic interactions were interpolated from a sparse grid. The 3D-RISM equation was coupled with the PSE-3 closure and solved to a residual tolerance of 10e-10. The large solvent box size and low residual tolerance provide a numerical accuracy of at least 0.01 kcal/mol. SFEs were calculated by applying PC+/DFT [16] to the closed form analytic expression for the PSE-3 closure [6].  To assess the model accuracy, the above procedure was applied to calculate partition coefficients for neutral amino acid side chain analogues [15]. The error estimates for our SAMPL5 predictions are taken from the RMSE in this test set.'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in neutral state in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution. The provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute molecule in each solvent, for all solutes. The number of solvent molecules was determined in order to create a box with at least 4.0 nm on each edge, so at least 2124 water molecules in each case, and 352 in the case of cyclohexane.  Solute, Water, and cyclohexane were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of Quantum Mechanical Polarizable Force Field (QMPFFF3) see e.g. (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242).'

aS'Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 10 lambda states, while annihilation was done for all interactions in similar way as it was done for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378). Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 450 ps production phase at each lambda value using a Berendsen barostat and Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 0.5 ps and 1 ps, respectively of which we typically discarded another 50 ps as equilibration.  In cases where convergence was suspect, longer simulation times were employed.'
p2131
aS'Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points, and  were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted distribution coefficients) reported. The statistical errors (SEM) of the run was determined not by multiple runs, but by analysis of correlation times (as in supplementary materials of PNAS (2008) 105:10378).'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in neutral state in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution. The provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute molecule in each solvent, for all solutes. The number of solvent molecules was determined in order to create a box with at least 4.0 nm on each edge, so at least 2124 water molecules in each case, and 352 in the case of cyclohexane.  Solute, Water, and cyclohexane were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of Quantum Mechanical Polarizable Force Field (QMPFFF3) see e.g. (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242) and its subsequent modification/improvement called ARROW.'

aS'Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 10 lambda states, while annihilation was done for all interactions in similar way as it was done for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378). Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 450 ps production phase at each lambda value using a Berendsen barostat and Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 0.5 ps and 1 ps, respectively of which we typically discarded another 50 ps as equilibration. In cases where convergence was suspect, longer simulation times were employed.'
p2398
aS'Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points, and  were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted distribution coefficients) reported. The statistical errors (SEM) of the run was determined not by multiple runs, but by analysis of correlation times (as in supplementary materials of PNAS (2008) 105:10378).'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p2526
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'

aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

aS'Bulk solvent properties for use in 3D-RISM calculations were produced with rism1d in AmberTools 15 using the partial series expansion of order 3 (PSE-3) [6] closure. Water was represented with the cSPC/E water model [7] while a united atom model was developed for cyclohexane. An initial parameterization for cyclohexane used typical united atom Lennard-Jones parameters but was found to give a negative isothermal compressibility, indicating an unphysical solution. An alternate model was developed by calculating XRISM [8,9] solutions for a range of larger sigma and epsilon values and using these solutions to calculate free energies for a training set of 84 solutes in cyclohexane [10] when using the Universal Correction (UC) [11] with the 3D-RISM procedure described below. SMILES strings for all training set solutes were obtained from PubChem and converted to .mol2 files using OpenBabel 2.3.2 [12]. Topologies and coordinates were then assigned as described for the SAMPL5 solutes. Values of sigma = 4.3 to 5.3 A and epsilon = 0.8, 0.988 and 1.4 kcal/mol were used for cyclohexane and the final parameters of sigma = 4.7 A and epsilon = 1.4 kcal/mol were selected. SFEs from these parameters and corrected with UC compared well against the training data, with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.650 kcal/mol, mean unsigned error = 0.539 kcal/mol, R^2 = 0.832 and a slope of 0.789. In addition, the isothermal compressibility was 0.71 1/GPa, close to the experimental value of 1.120 1/GPa [13], and the radial distribution function was in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and neutron and X-ray diffraction results [14].'

aS'SFE were calculated using the rism3d.snglpnt program in AmberTools 15 [7]. A 0.3 A grid spacing was used for the solvent box with a minimum 30 A buffer distance between the solute and the box edge. A 30 A cut off was used for solvent-solute interactions, beyond which Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated and electrostatic interactions were interpolated from a sparse grid. The 3D-RISM equation was coupled with the PSE-3 closure and solved to a residual tolerance of 10e-10. The large solvent box size and low residual tolerance provide a numerical accuracy of at least 0.01 kcal/mol. SFEs were calculated by applying UC to the closed form analytic expression for the PSE-3 closure [6]. UC coefficients for cyclohexane were determined using our training data, as described above, and coefficients for cSPC/E were determined in previous work [17]. To assess the model accuracy, the above procedure was applied to calculate partition coefficients for neutral amino acid side chain analogues [15]. The error estimates for our SAMPL5 predictions are taken from the RMSE in this test set.'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated by combining statistical-mechanical calculations using a modified EC-RISM solvation model (JPCB 112, 4337, 2008) for neutral forms of the compounds in both water (mSPC/E, JCAMD 24, 343, 2010 and cyclohexane (united atom, JCC 22, 1205, 2001), combined with an empirical estimate of the most abundant neutral tautomers at pH 7.4 using MoKa, and Corina for generating 3D structures. Protonation  equilibria were ignored in this prediction set. If the relative abundance of tautomers were comparable, only the globally optimal tautomer from EC-RISM calculations (see below) was selected for further investigation.'
p3020
aS'The key equation evaluated is:'
p3021
aS'logD = logP'
p3022
aS'logP was computed from the difference of solvation free energies of species between cyclohexanol and water. Solvation free energies within the EC-RISM context are given by the difference of vacuum and solution electronic energy plus a 3D RISM-derived estimate of the excess chemical potential (my^ex). Here we first adjust the original PSE-2 closure expression (JCP 129, 236101, 2008) with a partial molar volume (PMV) correction using available data from the Minnesota Solvation Database for water and cyclohexane solvation free energies. For water and cyclohexane a two-parameter model (scaling my^ex and PMV) was chosen, yielding independent estimates of the model error of 1.2 kcal/mol (neutrals, 2.0 kcal/mol including ions) for water and 0.8 kcal/mol for cyclohexane. Applying the optimized water parameters to the subset of cyclohexane data for which water solvation free energies are also available, yields an error of 1.5 kcal/mol for water. These errors (1.5 and 0.8 kcal/mol) give a propagation estimate of the total model error of at least 1.6 for logD (the true error is definitely larger due to the neglect of protonation equilibria). The statistical error estimate resulting from computing the RMSD between a 2-parameter and a 3-parameter cyclohexane model is around 0.9 for logD.'
p3023
aS'Technically, (1) the conformations of all species were first sampled by generating a set of 200 geometries using a distance geometry embedding scheme with the default settings of RDKit. (2) Geometry optimization was performed in effective dielectric environments representing both phases using the ALPB model in Amber with GAFF 1.5 and AM1-BCC charges. (3) Clustering using RDKit with the criteria to select structures with max. 5 kcal/mol of their force field energy above the global minimum and structural RMSD < 0.5 Angstroems was followed by (4) quantum-chemical optimization in the respective PCM solvent (Gaussian 09) by B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p). (5) Only the globally optimal structure was subjected to further EC-RISM/3D-RISM treatment. For cyclohexane, we assumed gas and solution phase geometries to be identical whereas a relaxation term was accounted for in the case of water. (6) EC-RISM calculations in water were done by MP2/6-311+G(d,p)/PSE-2 (Gaussian 03 as quantum chemistry package). (7) 3D-RISM/PSE-2 was sufficient for the uncharged united atom cyclohexane model. The corresponding solvent site susceptibility was constructed by extracting intermolecular and intramolecular correlation functions from explicit MD simulations of pure cyclohexane using Gromacs.'

S'Distribution coefficients were here estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in water and cyclohexane using the SMD solvation model with bp3w91/cc-pvqz. The difference between the solvation does not include thermal correction, thus the free energy of solvation between water and cyclohexane is only difference between the electronic energies.'

S'Distribution coefficients were calculated for all solutes using the difference in solvation free energy (SFE) at infinite dilution in water and cyclohexane as calculated by the 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) [1,2]. Parameters for solute topologies and coordinates from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [3] were assigned with the antechamber, parmchk2 and tleap programs in AmberTools 15 [4], starting from the provided .mol2 files. No attempt was made to predict tautomer or protonation state.'

aS'Solvent Models'
p3201
aS'Bulk solvent properties for use in 3D-RISM calculations were produced with rism1d in AmberTools 15 using the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) [5] closure. Water was represented with the cSPC/E water model [7] while a united atom model was developed for cyclohexane. An initial parameterization for cyclohexane used typical united atom Lennard-Jones parameters but was found to give a negative isothermal compressibility, indicating an unphysical solution. An alternate model was developed by calculating XRISM [8,9] solutions for a range of larger sigma and epsilon values and using these solutions to calculate free energies for a training set of 84 solutes in cyclohexane [10] when using the Universal Correction (UC) [11] with the 3D-RISM procedure described below. SMILES strings for all training set solutes were obtained from PubChem and converted to .mol2 files using OpenBabel 2.3.2 [12]. Topologies and coordinates were then assigned as described for the SAMPL5 solutes. Values of sigma = 4.3 to 5.3 A and epsilon = 0.8, 0.988 and 1.4 kcal/mol were used for cyclohexane and the final parameters of sigma = 4.7 A and epsilon = 1.4 kcal/mol were selected. SFEs from these parameters and corrected with UC compared well against the training data, with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.652 kcal/mol, mean unsigned error = 0.545 kcal/mol, R^2 = 0.829 and a slope of 0.815. In addition, the isothermal compressibility was 0.51 1/GPa, close to the experimental value of 1.120 1/GPa [13], and the radial distribution function was in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and neutron and X-ray diffraction results [14].'
p3202
aS'3D-RISM'
p3203
aS'SFE were calculated using the rism3d.snglpnt program in AmberTools 15 [7]. A 0.3 A grid spacing was used for the solvent box with a minimum 30 A buffer distance between the solute and the box edge. A 30 A cut off was used for solvent-solute interactions, beyond which Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated and electrostatic interactions were interpolated from a sparse grid. The 3D-RISM equation was coupled with the KH closure and solved to a residual tolerance of 10e-10. The large solvent box size and low residual tolerance provide a numerical accuracy of at least 0.01 kcal/mol. SFEs were calculated by applying UC to the closed form analytic expression for the KH closure [5]. UC coefficients for cyclohexane were determined using our training data, as described above, and coefficients for cSPC/E were determined in previous work [17]. To assess the model accuracy, the above procedure was applied to calculate partition coefficients for neutral amino acid side chain analogues [15]. The error estimates for our SAMPL5 predictions are taken from the RMSE in this test set.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p3492
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'

aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

p3499
aS'Protocol C) Same as B but a correction term for electrostatic energies was also applied. This term was adapted from Reif and Oostenbrink (J. Comput. Chem. 2014, 35, 227-243) to handle corrections for an atom-based Barker Watts reaction-field cutoff. Poisson electrostatic calculations were performed with the software APBS and a custom periodic-boundary Poisson solver that was kindly provided by Prof. Philippe H\xc3\xbcnenberger (ETH Zurich).'

S'Distribution coefficients were calculated for all solutes using the difference in solvation free energy (SFE) at infinite dilution in water and cyclohexane as calculated by the 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) [1,2]. Parameters for solute topologies and coordinates from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [3] were assigned with the antechamber, parmchk2 and tleap programs in AmberTools 15 [4], starting from the provided .mol2 files. No attempt was made to predict tautomer or protonation state.'

aS'Solvent Models'
p3546
aS'Bulk solvent properties for use in 3D-RISM calculations were produced with rism1d in AmberTools 15 using the partial series expansion of order 3 (PSE-3) [6] closure. Water was represented with the cSPC/E water model [7] while a united atom model was developed for cyclohexane. An initial parameterization for cyclohexane used typical united atom Lennard-Jones parameters but was found to give a negative isothermal compressibility, indicating an unphysical solution. An alternate model was developed by calculating XRISM [8,9] solutions for a range of larger sigma and epsilon values and using these solutions to calculate free energies for a training set of 84 solutes in cyclohexane [10] when using the Universal Correction (UC) [11] with the 3D-RISM procedure described below. SMILES strings for all training set solutes were obtained from PubChem and converted to .mol2 files using OpenBabel 2.3.2 [12]. Topologies and coordinates were then assigned as described for the SAMPL5 solutes. Values of sigma = 4.3 to 5.3 A and epsilon = 0.8, 0.988 and 1.4 kcal/mol were used for cyclohexane and the final parameters of sigma = 4.7 A and epsilon = 1.4 kcal/mol were selected. SFEs from these parameters and corrected with UC compared well against the training data, with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.650 kcal/mol, mean unsigned error = 0.539 kcal/mol, R^2 = 0.832 and a slope of 0.789. In addition, the isothermal compressibility was 0.71 1/GPa, close to the experimental value of 1.120 1/GPa [13], and the radial distribution function was in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and neutron and X-ray diffraction results [14].'

aS'3D-RISM'
p3548
aS'SFE were calculated using the rism3d.snglpnt program in AmberTools 15 [7]. A 0.3 A grid spacing was used for the solvent box with a minimum 30 A buffer distance between the solute and the box edge. A 30 A cut off was used for solvent-solute interactions, beyond which Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated and electrostatic interactions were interpolated from a sparse grid. The 3D-RISM equation was coupled with the PSE-3 closure and solved to a residual tolerance of 10e-10. The large solvent box size and low residual tolerance provide a numerical accuracy of at least 0.01 kcal/mol. SFEs were calculated by applying PC+/3D-RISM [16] to the closed form analytic expression for the PSE-3 closure [6].  To assess the model accuracy, the above procedure was applied to calculate partition coefficients for neutral amino acid side chain analogues [15]. The error estimates for our SAMPL5 predictions are taken from the RMSE in this test set.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p3695
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'

aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p3697
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p3972
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'
p3973
aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p3974
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'
p3975
aS'All the other molecules were simulated with the provided files.'

aS'The absolute free energies obtained by use of the above protocol were corrected to account for specific errors:'
p3977
aS'Protocol A) A correction term for missing no cutoff interactions in Coulombic potential in vacuum simulations'
p3978
aS'Protocol B) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding.'
p3979
aS'Protocol C) Same as B but a correction term for electrostatic energies was also applied. This term was adapted from Reif and Oostenbrink (J. Comput. Chem. 2014, 35, 227-243) to handle corrections for an atom-based Barker Watts reaction-field cutoff. Poisson electrostatic calculations were performed with the software APBS and a custom periodic-boundary Poisson solver that was kindly provided by Prof. Philippe H\xc3\xbcnenberger (ETH Zurich).'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated by combining statistical-mechanical calculations using a modified EC-RISM solvation model (JPCB 112, 4337, 2008) for neutral forms of the compounds in both water (mSPC/E, JCAMD 24, 343, 2010 and cyclohexane (united atom, JCC 22, 1205, 2001), combined with an empirical estimate of pKa/b values of the most abundant neutral tautomers at pH 7.4 using MoKa, and Corina for generating 3D structures. If the relative abundance of tautomers were comparable, only the globally optimal tautomer from EC-RISM calculations (see below) was selected for further investigation.'

aS'logP was computed from the difference of solvation free energies of species between cyclohexanol and water. Solvation free energies within the EC-RISM context are given by the difference of vacuum and solution electronic energy plus a 3D RISM-derived estimate of the excess chemical potential (my^ex). Here we first adjust the original PSE-2 closure expression (JCP 129, 236101, 2008) with a partial molar volume (PMV) correction using available data from the Minnesota Solvation Database for water and cyclohexane solvation free energies. For water and cyclohexane a two-parameter model (scaling my^ex and PMV) was chosen, yielding independent estimates of the model error of 1.2 kcal/mol (neutrals) for water and 0.8 kcal/mol for cyclohexane. Applying the optimized water parameters to the subset of cyclohexane data for which water solvation free energies are also available, yields an error of 1.5 kcal/mol for water. These errors (1.5 and 0.8 kcal/mol) together with the MoKa pK error estimate of 0.9 (JCIM 47, 2172, 2007) give a propagation estimate of the total model error of at least 1.8 for logD. The statistical error estimate resulting from computing the RMSD between a 2-parameter and a 3-parameter cyclohexane model is around 0.9 for logD.'

(3) Clustering using RDKit with the criteria to select structures with max. 5 kcal/mol of their force field energy above the global minimum and structural RMSD < 0.5 Angstroems was followed by (4) quantum-chemical optimization in the respective PCM solvent (Gaussian 09) by B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p).

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in neutral state in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution. The provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute molecule in each solvent, for all solutes. The number of solvent molecules was determined in order to create a box with at least 4.0 nm on each edge, so at least 2124 water molecules in each case, and 352 in the case of cyclohexane.  Solute, Water, and cyclohexane were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of Quantum Mechanical Polarizable Force Field (QMPFFF3) see e.g. (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242) and its subsequent modification/improvement called ARROW. Some systematic errors related to hydrophobic parts of molecules was corrected.'
p4765
aS'In-house tools in the Arbalest code and various scripts in Octave/Matlab were used for setting up the initial configuration and subsequent post processing of generated data.'
p4766
aS'Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 10 lambda states, while annihilation was done for all interactions in similar way as it was done for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378). Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 450 ps production phase at each lambda value using a Berendsen barostat and Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 0.5 ps and 1 ps, respectively of which we typically discarded another 50 ps as equilibration. In cases where convergence was suspect, longer simulation times were employed.'
p4767
aS'Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points, and  were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted distribution coefficients) reported. The statistical errors (SEM) of the run was determined not by multiple runs, but by analysis of correlation times (as in supplementary materials of PNAS (2008) 105:10378).'

aS'Simulation Protocol'
p4941
aS'The provided mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute'
p4942
aS'molecule in each solvent. Simulations were performed under periodic boundary'
p4943
aS'conditions in a rhombic dodecahedral simulation box. Box sizes were chosen so that'
p4944
aS'there were at least 1.5 nm between the solute at any box edge for the'
p4945
aS'cyclohexane simulations and 1.0 nm for water as solvent.'
p4946
aS'MDPOW (based on GromacsWrapper and Gromacs) was used to automate the generation'
p4947
aS'of input files for Gromacs. The simulations followed our previous work on'
p4948
aS'SAMPL3 and SAMPL4. In short, each system was energy minimized with the steepest'
p4949
aS'descent minimizer and relaxed with a 100 ps MD run with a 0.1 fs time step in'
p4950
aS'the NPT ensemble, followed by a 15 ns NPT MD at 2 fs time step for'
p4951
aS'equilibration (except SAMPL5_083 where we only ran for 1.5 ns; see below). Both'
p4952
aS'simulations used Berendsen pressure coupling (P=1 bar) and Langevin dynamics'
p4953
aS'for temperature control (T=300 K). The final conformation of the equilibration'
p4954
aS'simulation was taken as the starting point for windowed alchemical solvation'

p4956
aS'broken into 5 lambda windows for Coulomb decharging and 16 windows for'
p4957
aS'Lennard-Jones (VDW) decoupling. LJ decoupling used soft-cores with alpha=0.5,'

p4959
aS'whereby only intra-molecular interactions between solute and solvent are'
p4960
aS'changed with lambda, so that the simulations directly yield solvation free'

p4962
aS'in NVT (except SAMPL5_083 where we only ran for 0.5 ns; see below) and all data'

aS'were used for subsequent analysis using thermodynamic integration (TI) (using'

p4978
aS'(Equilibrium) and 0.5 ns (FEP). Even the standard conditions would probably'

aS'have not been enough to sample the conformational flexibility of this very big'
p4980
aS'and quite flexible macrocycle. The prediction submitted for this compound'
p4981
aS'corresponds to the conformation provided within the SAMPL5 dataset, but we have'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the neutral solute into cyclohexane and water. Solvation free energies were calculated in explicit solvent with GROMACS in the generalized amber force field (GAFF) and AM1-BCC charges.'
p5114
aS'The Solvation Toolkit (using Packmol, OpenMolTools, AmberTools and ParmEd) was used to build input files for each of the solutes in cyclohexane and water from the provided SMILE strings. The number of solvent molecules were chosen such that the box edge was at least 3 nm (1000 TIP3P water molecules or 500 cyclohexane molecules). Solvation free energies were calculated at infinite dilution so only 1 solute molecule was included.'
p5115
aS'Generally protocols were taken from previous work with relative solubility calculations in our group and updated to work with GROMACS 5.0.4. The alchemical solvation was broken into 20 lambda states. In the first 5 lambda states the electrostatic interactions between the solute and solvent were turned off. Then the Van der Waals interactions (modeled by Lennard Jones potentials) were switched off in the last 15 lambda states. Each state was minimized using GROMACS steepest decent algorithm and then equilibrated for a total of 150ps. The equilibration was broken into three steps: (1) 50ps constant volume, (2) 50ps constant pressure with the Berendsen barostat, and (3) 50ps constant pressure with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat.  These were followed by a 5ns production phase at each lambda state, still using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat. The initial 100ps of the production stage was thrown out to give the system extra time to reach equilibrium.'
p5116
aS'The free energy difference between each lambda value and the total solvation free energy was calculated using the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) through the Alchemical Analysis tool. This included a statistical uncertainty of the solvation free energy which was propagated to get the statistical uncertainty in the logarithm of the distribution coefficient. The model error was taken as the RMS error of a previous study of partition coefficients between water and cyclohexane.'

aS'We are continuing to explore issues of convergence of the larger molecules in this set.'

aS'(0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00). Then the van der Waals interactions were turned off in 24 lambda points using soft core potentials as implemented in'
p5253
aS'the PERT module of CHARMM (lambda = 0.00, 1/23, 2/23 ... 1.00). For molecules 65, 83 and 92, an additional lambda point was introduced at lambda=0.978. To'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solutes in water and cyclohexene. log D = [dG(wat)-dG(cyclohex.)] / 2.3 RT'
p5680
aS'The provided input files for Lammps where used as a starting point. The force field and conformation of the solutes where taken as provided,  whereas the solvent molecules where coarse-grained with in-house tools. The solvent molecules where described with the coarse-grained ELBA model. The system was minimized and equilibrated for 1.2 ns in the NPT ensemble.'
p5681
aS'In general,  the protocol from a recent publication in JCTC (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00963) was used. The solvation free energy was estimated from decoupling the solute from the surrounding using thermodynamic integration. The potential was scaled with a fourth-power function and twenty-five equally spaced values of lambda was used from 0 to 0.96. Lambda = 1.0 was estimated by linear extrapolation and integration was carried out with trapezoid integration. Electrostatics and van der Waals forces were decoupled concurrently. 1.2 ns of equilibration and 3.6 data collection was simulated (in NPT) at each value of lambda. The sampling frequency was 0.3 ps. Five (for simulations in cyclohexane) or ten (for simulations in water) independent repeats were initiated by assigning different initial velocities.'
p5682
aS'Analysis was carried out with in-house tools. The reported standard error is the standard error over the five or ten repeats,  propagated to log D.'
p5683
aS'No attempt has been made to predict likely protonation states of the compounds,  or how different tautomers affect the log D calculations.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p5808
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'
p5809
aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p5810
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in neutral state in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution. The provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute molecule in each solvent, for all solutes. The number of solvent molecules was determined in order to create a box with at least 4.0 nm on each edge, so at least 2124 water molecules in each case, and 352 in the case of cyclohexane.  Solute, Water, and cyclohexane were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of Quantum Mechanical Polarizable Force Field (QMPFFF3) see e.g. (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242).'
p6451
aS'In-house tools in the Arbalest code and various scripts in Octave/Matlab were used for setting up the initial configuration and subsequent post processing of generated data. Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 10 lambda states, while annihilation was done for all interactions in similar way as it was done for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378). Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 450 ps production phase at each lambda value using a Berendsen barostat and Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 0.5 ps and 1 ps, respectively of which we typically discarded another 50 ps as equilibration. In cases where convergence was suspect, longer simulation times were employed. Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points, and  were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted distribution coefficients) reported. The statistical errors (SEM) of the run was determined not by multiple runs, but by analysis of correlation times (as in supplementary materials of PNAS (2008) 105:10378).'

S'Distribution coefficients were calculated for all solutes using the difference in solvation free energy (SFE) at infinite dilution in water and cyclohexane as calculated by the 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) [1,2]. Parameters for solute topologies and coordinates from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [3] were assigned with the antechamber, parmchk2 and tleap programs in AmberTools 15 [4], starting from the provided .mol2 files. No attempt was made to predict tautomer or protonation state.'
p6721
aS'Solvent Models'
p6722
aS'Bulk solvent properties for use in 3D-RISM calculations were produced with rism1d in AmberTools 15 using the partial series expansion of order 3 (PSE-3) [6] closure. Water was represented with the cSPC/E water model [7] while a united atom model was developed for cyclohexane. An initial parameterization for cyclohexane used typical united atom Lennard-Jones parameters but was found to give a negative isothermal compressibility, indicating an unphysical solution. An alternate model was developed by calculating XRISM [8,9] solutions for a range of larger sigma and epsilon values and using these solutions to calculate free energies for a training set of 84 solutes in cyclohexane [10] when using the Universal Correction (UC) [11] with the 3D-RISM procedure described below. SMILES strings for all training set solutes were obtained from PubChem and converted to .mol2 files using OpenBabel 2.3.2 [12]. Topologies and coordinates were then assigned as described for the SAMPL5 solutes. Values of sigma = 4.3 to 5.3 A and epsilon = 0.8, 0.988 and 1.4 kcal/mol were used for cyclohexane and the final parameters of sigma = 4.7 A and epsilon = 1.4 kcal/mol were selected. SFEs from these parameters and corrected with UC compared well against the training data, with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.650 kcal/mol, mean unsigned error = 0.539 kcal/mol, R^2 = 0.832 and a slope of 0.789. In addition, the isothermal compressibility was 0.71 1/GPa, close to the experimental value of 1.120 1/GPa [13], and the radial distribution function was in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and neutron and X-ray diffraction results [14].'
p6723
aS'3D-RISM'
p6724
aS'SFE were calculated using the rism3d.snglpnt program in AmberTools 15 [7]. A 0.3 A grid spacing was used for the solvent box with a minimum 30 A buffer distance between the solute and the box edge. A 30 A cut off was used for solvent-solute interactions, beyond which Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated and electrostatic interactions were interpolated from a sparse grid. The 3D-RISM equation was coupled with the PSE-3 closure and solved to a residual tolerance of 10e-10. The large solvent box size and low residual tolerance provide a numerical accuracy of at least 0.01 kcal/mol. SFEs were calculated using the closed form analytic expression for the PSE-3 closure [6].  To assess the model accuracy, the above procedure was applied to calculate partition coefficients for neutral amino acid side chain analogues [15]. The error estimates for our SAMPL5 predictions are taken from the RMSE in this test set.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p6871
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'
p6872
aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p6873
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'
p6874
aS'All the other molecules were simulated with the provided files.'
p6875
aS'The absolute free energies obtained by use of the above protocol were corrected to account for specific errors:'
p6876
aS'Protocol A) A correction term for missing no cutoff interactions in Coulombic potential in vacuum simulations'
p6877
aS'Protocol B) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding.'

S'Distribution coefficients were here estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution using the field Semi-Explicit Assembly (SEA) solvation model. The solutes were represented using the GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges.'
p7002
aS'The SEA solvation models computes the solvation free energy for a solute molecules by rapidly assembling at runtime the precomputed solvation free energy of a set of model spheres. The computationally expensive precomputation step needs to be performed only once for every given solvent environment. Precomputed solvation free energy tables for model spheres in TIP3P water molecules were taken from previous work in our group. Solvation free energies for model spheres in cyclohexane were computed using a dielectric corrected united-atom (UA) model of the solvent. The optimization procedure was performed in order to obtain a UA solvent model that reproduces the experimental density, dielectric constant and enthalpy of vaporization of cyclohexane.'
p7003
aS'SEA performs free energy calculations on rigid molecules. In order to use the most representative conformation of the solutes in the respective solvents we performed a set of 5 ns simulations where each solute was immersed in explicit water or cyclohexane. These trajectories were clustered to extract out the representative conformation. As stated above, the solutes were modeled using the GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges. Solute parameters were assigned using antechamber and parmchk2, and the molecule was converted to GROMACS form using acpype.py. The explicit solvents where TIP3P water and our dielectrically corrected cyclohexane. Following minimization of the solvated systems (rhombic dodecahedral box with at least 12 \xc3\x85 of solvent between the solute and the periodic boundary walls), each solute box was first equilibrated under the NVT ensemble using the Berendsen thermostat for 100 ps, and subsequently it was equilibrated under the NPT ensemble for 200 ps (Langevin thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat). After equilibration for each box a 5ns NPT production trajectory was done. The dominant conformations of the solutes over their trajectories were determined with clustering using the g_cluster tool. This conformer was used for subsequent field SEA calculations.'
p7004
aS'In field SEA, the non-polar contribution to the solvation free energy was computed by constructing a Lee-Richards type solvent accessible surface using a dot density of roughly 300 dots per atom. Each exterior point was probed to determine the collective solvation field, and the appropriate free energy estimates were pulled from the precomputed sphere contours. The reported results are averaged over 20 independent calculations. The polar contribution to the solvation free energy was performed using the field SEA approach. As in the nonpolar term, the polar contribution comes from first building a solvent accessible surface of similar detail as the nonpolar surface. These field SEA results were averaged over 60 runs. In the case of the cyclohexane environment, a correction to account the contribution to the solvation free energy due to buried solute atoms was applied.'
p7005
aS'Statistical analysis was done using a block average over 5 blocks. The predicted distribution coefficients simply come from subtraction of the solvation free energies in the various states, with error propagated to the log(D) value. The systematic error comes from a comparison of the obtained result with explicit solvent calculation performed in our group, submitted separately.'

S'The work submitted here is the result of a joint collaboration between the'
p7417
aS'laboratories of Oliver Beckstein (Arizona State University, AZ, USA) and Bogdan'
p7418
aS'Iorga (CNRS-ICSN, Gif-sur-Yvette, France).'
p7419
aS'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free'
p7420
aS'energies of the solute (in its provided protonation and tautomer state, with'
p7421
aS'the exception of compound SAMPL5_042 for which two tautomeric states were'
p7422
aS'evaluated) in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution, calculated from'
p7423
aS'all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.'
p7424
aS'Parametrization'
p7425
aS'Interactions were parametrized with the OPLS-AA force field and the TIP4P water'
p7426
aS'model. Parameters were assigned by chemical similarity matching using mol2ff'
p7427
aS'(unreleased), which makes use of the CACTVS toolkit, and parametrization of'
p7428
aS'missing atom types.'
p7429
aS'The predictions reported in our two submissions are the same, except for'
p7430
aS'compounds SAMPL5_042 and SAMPL5_085. For SAMPL5_042, the prediction 1'
p7431
aS'corresponds to a parametrization involving the aromatic form'
p7432
aS'(3-hydroxy-pyridazine) of the heterocycle, whereas the prediction 2 (this file)'
p7433
aS'corresponds to the parametrization of the non-aromatic form of the heterocycle,'
p7434
aS'as provided in the SAMPL5 dataset. For SAMPL5_085, the prediction 1 corresponds'
p7435
aS'to a parametrization of the hydantoin using the urea and amide parameters,'
p7436
aS'whereas the prediction 2 (this file) corresponds to a parametrization using the'
p7437
aS'uracil parameters.'
p7438
aS'From the parametrization point of view, the compounds from the SAMPL5 dataset'
p7439
aS'can be classified in four groups:'
p7440
aS'- group 1 (chemical moieties available in the OPLS-AA force field): 04, 10, 11,'
p7441
aS'19, 26, 27, 49, 56, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75, 81, 82, 84, 86,'
p7442
aS'88'
p7443
aS'- group 2 (chemical moieties absent from the OPLS-AA force field, that have'
p7444
aS'been parameterized during this work): 05, 33, 42, 47, 59, 68, 92'
p7445
aS'- group 3 (parametrization of fused rings using the parameters of individual'
p7446
aS'rings): 07, 15, 17, 20, 44, 45, 48, 50, 55, 60, 90'
p7447
aS'- group 4 (a combination of the issues mentioned above, chemical moieties'
p7448
aS'difficult to parameterize, conformational issues): 02, 03, 06, 13, 21, 24,'
p7449
aS'37, 46, 58, 80, 83, 85'
p7450
aS'In this SAMPL5 challenge we have tentatively evaluated the parametrization of'
p7451
aS'fused rings (for which no parameters are available in the OPLS-AA force field)'
p7452
aS"using the parameters of the individual rings. We haven't validated yet this"
p7453
aS'approach, but if it proves to be pertinent it will greatly facilitate the'
p7454
aS'parametrization of new heterocyclic systems, extending the modularity and the'
p7455
aS'transferability of the parameters, which is the main philosophy of the OPLS-AA'
p7456
aS'force field.'
p7457
aS'We have also applied the protocol described very recently (Dodda et al., JCTC,'
p7458
aS'2015, 11, 4273, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00414) for the generation of CM5'
p7459
aS'charges. Our preliminary validation results (carried out on thiophene and'
p7460
aS'2-methyl-thiophene, for which experimental values of hydration free energies'
p7461
aS'are available) are very promising, showing an error in the prediction of about'
p7462
aS'0.43 and 0.02 kcal/mol, respectively.'
p7463
aS'Simulation Protocol'
p7464
aS'The provided mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute'
p7465
aS'molecule in each solvent. Simulations were performed under periodic boundary'
p7466
aS'conditions in a rhombic dodecahedral simulation box. Box sizes were chosen so that'
p7467
aS'there were at least 1.5 nm between the solute at any box edge for the'
p7468
aS'cyclohexane simulations and 1.0 nm for water as solvent.'
p7469
aS'MDPOW (based on GromacsWrapper and Gromacs) was used to automate the generation'
p7470
aS'of input files for Gromacs. The simulations followed our previous work on'
p7471
aS'SAMPL3 and SAMPL4. In short, each system was energy minimized with the steepest'
p7472
aS'descent minimizer and relaxed with a 100 ps MD run with a 0.1 fs time step in'
p7473
aS'the NPT ensemble, followed by a 15 ns NPT MD at 2 fs time step for'
p7474
aS'equilibration (except SAMPL5_083 where we only ran for 1.5 ns; see below). Both'
p7475
aS'simulations used Berendsen pressure coupling (P=1 bar) and Langevin dynamics'
p7476
aS'for temperature control (T=300 K). The final conformation of the equilibration'
p7477
aS'simulation was taken as the starting point for windowed alchemical solvation'
p7478
aS'free energy calculations with Gromacs. For all compounds calculations were'
p7479
aS'broken into 5 lambda windows for Coulomb decharging and 16 windows for'
p7480
aS'Lennard-Jones (VDW) decoupling. LJ decoupling used soft-cores with alpha=0.5,'
p7481
aS'power=1, and sigma=0.3. We made use of Gromacs "couple-intramol = no" feature'
p7482
aS'whereby only intra-molecular interactions between solute and solvent are'
p7483
aS'changed with lambda, so that the simulations directly yield solvation free'
p7484
aS'energies without need of a calculation in vacuoo. Each window was run for 5 ns'
p7485
aS'in NVT (except SAMPL5_083 where we only ran for 0.5 ns; see below) and all data'
p7486
aS'were used for subsequent analysis using thermodynamic integration (TI) (using'
p7487
aS"Simpson's rule as implemented in SciPy). The statistical error on the hydration"
p7488
aS'free energy was estimated from the errors of the individual windows, which in'
p7489
aS'turn were calculated taking into account the variance and the correlation time'
p7490
aS'of the data. Errors from TI windows were propagated analytically through'
p7491
aS"Simpson's rule (Newton-Coates formula for the 3rd interpolating Lagrange"
p7492
aS'polynomial) and summation of Coulomb and LJ terms.  The distribution'
p7493
aS'coefficients were directly calculated from the solvation free energies in water'
p7494
aS'and cyclohexane as'
p7495
aS'log D = (\\Delta G_w - \\Delta G_c)/kT log e'
p7496
aS'No attempt has been made in these calculations to predict likely protonation'
p7497
aS'states of the compounds, or how their pKa or possible changes in protonation'
p7498
aS'state might be likely to impact the distribution coefficients.'
p7499
aS'Compound SAMPL5_083 deserves a special mention. For time reasons before the'
p7500
aS'submission deadline, the simulations for this compound were ran only for 1.5 ns'
p7501
aS'(Equilibrium) and 0.5 ns (FEP). Even the standard conditions would probably'
p7502
aS'have not been enough to sample the conformational flexibility of this very big'
p7503
aS'and quite flexible macrocycle. The prediction submitted for this compound'
p7504
aS'corresponds to the conformation provided within the SAMPL5 dataset, but we have'
p7505
aS'already generated several other very different conformations for this compound,'
p7506
aS'which very likely will lead to different values predicted for log D. These'
p7507
aS'alternative conformations were not simulated because of lack of time before the'
p7508
aS'submission deadline.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p7768
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'
p7769
aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p7770
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

p7774
aS'Protocol B) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding.'

S"Distribution coefficients were here estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution using the field Semi-Explicit Assembly (SEA) solvation model. The solutes were represented using a scaled version of the the GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges. In particular charges were enhanced by ~20% and Lennard-Jones sigma parameters were increased following a simple linear relation that is applied as a function of the change in charge magnitude upon polarization enhancement. This scaling was performed in order to maintain the solute model's neat liquid density, and generally results in improved thermodynamic properties for the molecular models."
p8001
aS'The SEA solvation models computes the solvation free energy for a solute molecules by rapidly assembling at runtime the precomputed solvation free energy of a set of model spheres. The computationally expensive precomputation step needs to be performed only once for every given solvent environment. Precomputed solvation free energy tables for model spheres in TIP3P water molecules were taken from previous work in our group. Solvation free energies for model spheres in cyclohexane were computed using a dielectric corrected united-atom (UA) model of the solvent. The optimization procedure was performed in order to obtain a UA solvent model that reproduces the experimental density, dielectric constant and enthalpy of vaporization of cyclohexane.'
p8002
aS'SEA performs free energy calculations on rigid molecules. In order to use the most representative conformation of the solutes in the respective solvents we performed a set of 5 ns simulations where each solute was immersed in explicit water or cyclohexane. These trajectories were clustered to extract out the representative conformation. As stated above, the solutes were modeled using a scaled form of the GAFF force field with AM1-BCC partial charges. Solute parameters were assigned using antechamber and parmchk2, and the molecule was converted to GROMACS form using acpype.py. The charges and Lennard-Jones sigma parameters were then modulated as described above to obtain a model that is likely better represents the molecule in the condensed phase state. The explicit solvents where TIP3P water and our dielectrically corrected cyclohexane. Following minimization of the solvated systems (rhombic dodecahedral box with at least 12 \xc3\x85 of solvent between the solute and the periodic boundary walls), each solute box was first equilibrated under the NVT ensemble using the Berendsen thermostat for 100 ps, and subsequently it was equilibrated under the NPT ensemble for 200 ps (Langevin thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat). After equilibration for each box a 5ns NPT production trajectory was done. The dominant conformations of the solutes over their trajectories were determined with clustering using the g_cluster tool. This conformer was used for subsequent field SEA calculations.'
p8003
aS'In field SEA, the non-polar contribution to the solvation free energy was computed by constructing a Lee-Richards type solvent accessible surface using a dot density of roughly 300 dots per atom. Each exterior point was probed to determine the collective solvation field, and the appropriate free energy estimates were pulled from the precomputed sphere contours. The reported results are averaged over 20 independent calculations. The polar contribution to the solvation free energy was performed using the field SEA approach. As in the nonpolar term, the polar contribution comes from first building a solvent accessible surface of similar detail as the nonpolar surface. These field SEA results were averaged over 60 runs. In the case of the cyclohexane environment, a correction to account the contribution to the solvation free energy due to buried solute atoms was applied.'
p8004
aS'Statistical analysis was done using a block average over 5 blocks. The predicted distribution coefficients simply come from subtraction of the solvation free energies in the various states, with error propagated to the log(D) value. The systematic error comes from a comparison of the obtained result with explicit solvent calculation performed in our group, submitted separately.'

S'Distribution coefficients were calculated for all solutes using the difference in solvation free energy (SFE) at infinite dilution in water and cyclohexane as calculated by the 3D-reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) [1,2]. Parameters for solute topologies and coordinates from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [3] were assigned with the antechamber, parmchk2 and tleap programs in AmberTools 15 [4], starting from the provided .mol2 files. No attempt was made to predict tautomer or protonation state.'
p8132
aS'Solvent Models'
p8133
aS'Bulk solvent properties for use in 3D-RISM calculations were produced with rism1d in AmberTools 15 using the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) [5] closure. Water was represented with the cSPC/E water model [7] while a united atom model was developed for cyclohexane. An initial parameterization for cyclohexane used typical united atom Lennard-Jones parameters but was found to give a negative isothermal compressibility, indicating an unphysical solution. An alternate model was developed by calculating XRISM [8,9] solutions for a range of larger sigma and epsilon values and using these solutions to calculate free energies for a training set of 84 solutes in cyclohexane [10] when using the Universal Correction (UC) [11] with the 3D-RISM procedure described below. SMILES strings for all training set solutes were obtained from PubChem and converted to .mol2 files using OpenBabel 2.3.2 [12]. Topologies and coordinates were then assigned as described for the SAMPL5 solutes. Values of sigma = 4.3 to 5.3 A and epsilon = 0.8, 0.988 and 1.4 kcal/mol were used for cyclohexane and the final parameters of sigma = 4.7 A and epsilon = 1.4 kcal/mol were selected. SFEs from these parameters and corrected with UC compared well against the training data, with root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.652 kcal/mol, mean unsigned error = 0.545 kcal/mol, R^2 = 0.829 and a slope of 0.815. In addition, the isothermal compressibility was 0.51 1/GPa, close to the experimental value of 1.120 1/GPa [13], and the radial distribution function was in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and neutron and X-ray diffraction results [14].'
p8134
aS'3D-RISM'
p8135
aS'SFE were calculated using the rism3d.snglpnt program in AmberTools 15 [7]. A 0.3 A grid spacing was used for the solvent box with a minimum 30 A buffer distance between the solute and the box edge. A 30 A cut off was used for solvent-solute interactions, beyond which Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated and electrostatic interactions were interpolated from a sparse grid. The 3D-RISM equation was coupled with the KH closure and solved to a residual tolerance of 10e-10. The large solvent box size and low residual tolerance provide a numerical accuracy of at least 0.01 kcal/mol. SFEs were calculated using the closed form analytic expression for the KH closure [5].  To assess the model accuracy, the above procedure was applied to calculate partition coefficients for neutral amino acid side chain analogues [15]. The error estimates for our SAMPL5 predictions are taken from the RMSE in this test set.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p8282
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'

aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p8284
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

p8288

aS'(0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00). Then the van der Waals interactions were turned off in 24 lambda points using soft core potentials as implemented in'

aS'the PERT module of CHARMM (lambda = 0.00, 1/23, 2/23 ... 1.00). For molecules 65, 83 and 92, an additional lambda point was introduced at lambda=0.978. To'

S'Distribution coefficients were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of the solute in neutral state in water and cyclohexane at infinite dilution. The provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes with a single solute molecule in each solvent, for all solutes. The number of solvent molecules was determined in order to create a box with at least 4.0 nm on each edge, so at least 2124 water molecules in each case, and 352 in the case of cyclohexane.  Solute, Water, and cyclohexane were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of Quantum Mechanical Polarizable Force Field (QMPFFF3) see e.g. (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242) and its subsequent modification/improvement called ARROW.'
p8787
aS'In-house tools in the Arbalest code and various scripts in Octave/Matlab were used for setting up the initial configuration and subsequent post processing of generated data.'
p8788
aS'Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 10 lambda states, while annihilation was done for all interactions in similar way as it was done for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378). Each solvated system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 450 ps production phase at each lambda value using a Berendsen barostat and Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 0.5 ps and 1 ps, respectively of which we typically discarded another 50 ps as equilibration. In cases where convergence was suspect, longer simulation times were employed.'
p8789
aS'Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points, and  were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted distribution coefficients) reported. The statistical errors (SEM) of the run was determined not by multiple runs, but by analysis of correlation times (as in supplementary materials of PNAS (2008) 105:10378).'
p8790
aS'In this submission no corrections based on protonation states were made.'

S'All the simulations were performed with Sire 15.1/OpenMM 6.3  (https://github.com/michellab/Sire, 10.1021/ct300857j), using single topology relative free energy calculations and multistate Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) (doi:10.1063/1.2978177)  to evaluate free energy changes in cyclohexane and water phase. A two step protocol was followed, with partial charges of the compound turned off firstly, which was followed by a second calculation where Lennard-Jones interactions were removed. The absolute free energy of hydration and solvation in cyclohexane was obtained by subtracting the free energy change for this process in solution from the  free energy in vacuum. Hence, the distribution coefficient was calcualted as the difference from  absolute hydration free energy and absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane divided by the Boltzmann factor times 2.303.'
p9202
aS'Each discharging step was divided into 9 equidistant lambda windows. For the vanishing step, 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. Every lambda simulation were normally run for 4 ns,  with all bonds constrained, to allow the usage of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) protocol (10.1021/ct5010406), setting the simulation time step to 4 fs, both for water and bound state. All the simulations were performed at 298 K and 1 atm, in the NPT ensemble, with the atom-based Barker Watts reaction field cutoff. The temperature control was achieved with an Andersen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. A Monte Carlo barostat was used for the pressure control, attempting isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs.  The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'

aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'
p9204
aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

p9208
aS'Protocol B) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding.'
p9209
aS'Protocol C) Same as B but a correction term for electrostatic energies was also applied. This term was adapted from Reif and Oostenbrink (J. Comput. Chem. 2014, 35, 227-243) to handle corrections for an atom-based Barker Watts reaction-field cutoff. Poisson electrostatic calculations were performed with the software APBS and a custom periodic-boundary Poisson solver that was kindly provided by Prof. Philippe H\xc3\xbcnenberger (ETH Zurich).'

The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Angstrom and a dielectric constant of 78.3 was used for the electrostatic interactions. Each step was run twice, in order to enhance consistency of results. Furhtermore for molecules 71, 56, 42, 7, 13, 19, 92, 65, 24 and 88, the vanishing step was 6 ns long, to reach a better convergence of results. From the absolute free energies two indipendent  distribution coefficients were calcualted. The final distribution coefficient was calculated averaging these values. Thus, the standard error was computed as the ratio of the standard deviation of the distribution coefficient for each run divided by the square root of the number of the runs.'

aS'For each compound the protonation state was considered. In particular compound: 15, 70, 61, 37, 72, 60, 63, 26, 10, 11, 81, 67, 82, 65, 69, 75, 86 and 84 were modeled as charged at pH 7.4.'

aS'For this compounds the provided .mol2 files were used to build solvated boxes in cyclohexane and water, using tLeap. The final cubic box measured on average 30 Angstrom along each edge, with TIP3P water molecules and GAFF cyclohexane. The resulting systems were energy minimized for 200 steepest decent steps, and equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm for 10 ps using Sander. Finally a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation was run with Sire, in order to reach a stable box density of approximately 1 g/cc.'

aS'The absolute free energies obtained by use of the above protocol were corrected to account for specific errors:'
p9300
aS'Protocol A) A correction term for missing no cutoff interactions in Coulombic potential in vacuum simulations'
p9301
aS'Protocol B) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding.'
p9302
aS'Protocol C) Same as B but a correction term for electrostatic energies was also applied. This term was adapted from Reif and Oostenbrink (J. Comput. Chem. 2014, 35, 227-243) to handle corrections for an atom-based Barker Watts reaction-field cutoff. Poisson electrostatic calculations were performed with the software APBS and a custom periodic-boundary Poisson solver that was kindly provided by Prof. Philippe H\xc3\xbcnenberger (ETH Zurich).'
p9303
aS'Protocol D) Protocol C were applied for charged compounds, while protocol B for neutral ones.'

aS'The trajectories of the solute in water and cyclohexane were generated with CHARMM and the CHARMM General Force field. The underlying trajectories'
p9716
aS'were 1-5ns long and frames were saved every 1ps. To increase sampling, Hamiltonian Replica exchange was used between the lambda points. The water simulations'
p9717
aS'were conduced in cubic boxes with a box length between 38.55 and 38.75 Angstrom, using 1906 TIP3P water molecules.The free energy analysis was conducted'
p9718
aS'with Non-Boltzmann Bennett, using the solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions for the biasing potential. Statistical uncertainties were calculated by'
