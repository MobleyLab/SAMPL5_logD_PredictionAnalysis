This directory was created when the Mobley group was under the impression that the experimental data was going to be provided with confidence intervals instead of uncertainties. 
Given the final version of the experimental data was given with a measured value and one uncertainty this directory is unnecesary.
I don't like deleting things so please just ignore it for now.
