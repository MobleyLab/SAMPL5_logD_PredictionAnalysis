# Tautomer Reruns

We reanalyzed a new tautomer for SAMPL5_050 and SAMPL5_083 to see how tautomer choice affected calculations of solvation free energy and state penalty. 

This directory contains the input and results files for those simulations. They used the same MDP files that were used for all other simulations.
