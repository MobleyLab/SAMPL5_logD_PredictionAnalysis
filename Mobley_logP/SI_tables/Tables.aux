The partition coefficient computed with these solvation free energies are reported as the estimate for $\mathop {\mathgroup \symoperators log}\nolimits D$. Statistical uncertainty (Stat. Unc.) was reported as the propogated error fro the solvation free energy calculations. The model uncertainty (Model Unc.) was estimated from a previous study of partition coefficients in the Mobley Group. }}{1}}
