Name:
QMNBB/OLYP/RELPKA/SOLV

Software:
CHARMM v.40a2
Gaussian 09 Rev. A2

Method:
MM trajectores were analysed with Gaussian, using DFT/BASIS and the SMD implicit solvent model for both water and cyclohexane. 
The trajectories of the solute in water and cyclohexane were generated with CHARMM and the CHARMM General Force field. The underlying trajectories 
were 5ns long and frames were saved every 1ps. To increase sampling, Hamiltonian Replica exchange was used between the lambda points. The water simulations 
were conduced in cubic boxes with a box length between 38.55 and 38.75 Angstrom, using 1906 TIP3P water molecules.The free energy analysis was conducted 
with Non-Boltzmann Bennett, using the solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions for the biasing potential. Statistical uncertainties were calculated by 
using block averages from 0.5ns blocks (or 500 snapshots).

Relative pKa calculations were performed to obtain free energies of ionization
in the aqueous phase. Tautomerization was also explored in the aqueous
solvent. Analogue structures for molecules were assigned manually, and
analogue pKa information was taken from widely available chemical data
bases, such a PubChem, or the CRC Handbook in most cases. No pKa corrections or
tautomerizations were attempted for molecule 83.

Fully relaxed geometry optimizations were performed for all QM optimizations
where applicable (pKa corrections if present, or solvantion free energy
calculations). Frequency and large basis set single point calculations were
also performed for the optimized solvent geometries. Molecule 83 was not
optimized in the various solvent phases, instead vertical calculations were
performed.
