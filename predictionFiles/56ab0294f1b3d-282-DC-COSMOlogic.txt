Method:
The distribution coefficient logD between the pure solvent phases water (1) and cyclohexane (2) has been computed for 53 SAMPL5 solutes using the COSMO-RS (Conductor-Like-Screening-Model for Real Solvents) method.
For all given solutes the cyclohexane-water partition coefficient logP has been computed from the difference of the chemical potentials of the solutes in the two given solvents, as predicted by the COSMO-RS method. 
The distribution coefficient logD between water and cyclohexane was computed from the predicted partition coefficient by applying the dissocation (in the case of acidic solutes), or protonation (in the case of basic solutes) corrections according to Henderson-Hasselbalch, assuming a physiological pH = 7.4. 
In the case of possible Zwitterion formation, the distribution coefficient logD has been computed directly from the partition sum of the free energies of all different species present in the reaction equilibrium (i.e. neutral  solute, zwitterion, cation(s), and anion(s)).
For all solute and solvents compounds, a set of relevant conformations has been computed and taken into account in the COSMO-RS compuation of the solute's chemical potentials.
For a number of solutes, additional tautomeric forms were computed. Thermodynamically relevant tautomeric forms have been found for solutes SAMPL_050, SAMPL_056, SAMPL_065, and SAMPL_083.
The COSMOthermX 16 software implementation of the COSMO-RS theory has been used to compute the infinite dilution chemical potential differences of all solutes between the solvents water and cyclohexane. 
The solvent phases have been assumed to be immisicble. The densities of the two liquid phases have been estimated by the COSMOthermX 16 software.
The acid dissociation constants pKa and base protonation constants pKb required for the computation of the dissociation/protonation correction to logP as well as for the reaction equilibria of the zwitterion-formation have been computed with the COSMO-RS theory using the COSMOthermX 16 software.
For solutes that contain a dimethylamino group, the base pKa's have been corrected empirically with a shift factor of + 0.7 pKa units, accounting for a systematic weakness of COSMO-RS pKa predictions for this functional group. In the SAMPL5 set this correction has been applied to compound SAMPL5_070,  SAMPL5_072, and SAMPL5_082, respectively.
The computation of the pKa and pKb values of the solutes required the computation of all possible deprotonated or protonated species, respectively.
The COSMO-RS prediction of the chemical potential of a solute in solution is based upon the quantum chemical descriptors (COSMO screening charge surfaces).
All quantum chemistry calculations of COSMO surfaces were done on BP//TZVPD//FINE Single Point level based upon a BP//TZVP//COSMO optimized geometry.
All COSMOthermX calculations (partition and pKa/pKb) were done with the BP-TZVPD-FINE-C30-1601 parameterization for the  BP//TZVPD//FINE level of quantum chemistry. 
For all compounds involved (solvents, solutes, tautomers, zwitterions, cations, anions) independent sets of relevant conformations have been computed with the COSMOconf software.
The quantum chemical calculations BP//TZVPD//FINE DFT calculations and the BP//TZVP//COSMO geometry optimizations were done with the TURBOMOLE 7.0 quantum chemistry software.
The statistical uncertainty of the COSMO-RS predictions is zero. Each prediction run will lead to the exact same results.
The model uncertainty of the COSMO-RS method is 0.5 log D units for compounds that neither dissociate nor protonate, it is 1.0 log D units for compounds that dissociate or protonate, and 1.5 log D units for compounds that with relevant tautomerisation.
