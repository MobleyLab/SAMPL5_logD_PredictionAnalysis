# Box and Whisker Plots

Box and Whisker plots show the range of predictions for each molecule. 
They also indicate the experimental value and the prediction made by that group. 

Each file has 3 plots, one for each batch. 
File labeled with a number included an idicated prediction value for each molecule if it was provided in that prediction set. 
boxplot_blank.pdf: Has a box and whisker plot for all predictions with the experimental value indicated, but no predicted values
